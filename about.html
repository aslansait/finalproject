      <p>Hi, my name is ASLAN ZHAMBOLOV and I'm a web developer. I've always been fascinated by technology and its potential to change the world. After completing my degree in computer science, I discovered my passion for web development and have been pursuing it ever since. </p>

       <p> As a web developer, I have experience in both front-end and back-end development. On the front-end, I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I enjoy creating beautiful and user-friendly interfaces that provide an engaging experience for users. On the back-end, I have experience with various server-side technologies like PHP, Node.js, and Java, and I enjoy building robust and scalable systems that power the web.</p>
        
       <p> My ultimate goal as a web developer is to use my skills to create innovative and impactful web applications that solve real-world problems. I believe that technology has the power to make a positive difference in people's lives, and I'm committed to using my skills to contribute to that vision.</p>
        
        <p> Thank you for taking the time to read my introduction. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any potential projects, please feel free to contact me.I'm a full stack softwar development student. This is my portfolio. </p>
